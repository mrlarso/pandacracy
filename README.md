# pandacracy

This program is designed to help with the structuring of a Holocracy-like organizational structure.

Team members will be able to see their roles, and vote on energy points.

The points will be stored in an database and the program will automatically calculate the bonus amounts for each team member.

There are two example csvs (circles.csv and roles_mini.csv) that can be used for testing.
